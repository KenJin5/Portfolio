Portfolio projects

Porfolio 1
Analysis of CSV data for cycling.
Find distributions of each variable by plotting histogram.
Checked correlation between Distance, Moving Time, Average Speed, Heart Rate, Power (watts), Normalised power (NP), Training Stress Score, Elevation Gain.
Explained linearity between variables.
I find the two variables average watts and normalised power interesting and it is explained why visually as well as having a explanation in my portfolio 1 file.
Investigate relationship between distance and max temp, as well as relationship between average speed and max temp.

Portfolio 2
Analysis of electricity consumption.
Examine appliances usage over whole period of analysis.
Examine appliances usage over first week of analysis.
Plot histogram to determine distribution of appliances usage.
Plot boxplot to determine mean, range and possible outliers
Create pairgrid to determine distribution of all variables as well as correlation between each other.
Create heatmap to determine usage of appliances according to hours.
Initiate logistic regression to find metric scores.
Plot residuals of appliances.
Picked best number of variables using RFE method.

Portfolio 3
Clean the data and select the columns that we want to use.
Use TfIdfVectorizer to find the common words
Train a Logistic Regression model for prediction.
Train a K-Nearest Neighbor Regression model for prediction.
Train a Random Forest Classifier model for prediction.
Train a Gaussian Naive Bayes model for prediction.
Select the best model to use based on accuracy score.
